# Starfield Macros (AutoHotkey)



A set of AutoHotkey v2.0 macros for Bethesda's Starfield, designed to automate and enhance gameplay with features like reactive shield recasting, vehicle flight mode, and invisibility toggling.
Since these macros run outside of the game engine, achievements aren't affected.

* **Vehicle Flight Mode (F7):** Enables "flight" mode for vehciles with extended or infinite boost. Adjustable flight and delay times.
* **Invisibility (F12):** Toggles Void Form for stealth. (Assumes '9' key is set for Void Form.)
